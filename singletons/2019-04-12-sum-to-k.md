#### Question
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

#### This
* Quick stab from repl, using `(range 5)` instead of an arbitrary list.
```clojure
conquer.core=> (for [x (range 5) y (range 5) :when (= 6 (+ x y))] [x y ])
([2 4] [3 3] [4 2])
```
* I'm not sure what the question means by _one pass_. I guess it basically means _"don't try to use nested for-loops"_ . 
But does that mean a list comprehension is not allowed? Heh. Especially here, clojure list comprehensions are lazy,
and since the question just cares about whether _"any two numbers add up to k"_ , we can stop as soon as we get one.

#### Going to see if my initial napkin code works also..

```clojure
(defn blah [vec k]
  (true? (take 1
            (for [x vec
                  y vec
                  :when (= (+ x y)
                            k)]
                  true))))
```
* OK heh the napkin code runs but looks like it is wrong heh,
```clojure
conquer.core=> (blah [10 15 3 7] 17)
false
```
* Going to print more explicitly to debug it,
```clojure
(defn candidator [vec k]
  (for [x vec
                  y vec
                  :when (= (+ x y)
                            k)]
                  [x y]))
```
* Ok seems to be good..
```clojure
conquer.core=> (candidator [10 15 3 7] 17)
([10 7] [7 10])
```
* Return inner why was it failing..
```clojure
(defn blah-inner [vec k]
  
            (for [x vec
                  y vec
                  :when (= (+ x y)
                            k)]
                  true))
```
```clojure
conquer.core=> (take 1 (blah-inner [10 15 3 7] 17))
(true)
conquer.core=> (true? (seq [true]))
false
```
* Ah duh a sequence of `true` is not _truthy_
* Should have used `first` instead of `take 1`
* Anyway, `empty?` shhould work too... still looks nice and lazy,
```clojure
conquer.core=> (time (empty? (candidator (range 10) 17)))
"Elapsed time: 0.127093 msecs"
false
conquer.core=> (time (empty? (candidator (range 100000) 17)))
"Elapsed time: 0.08306 msecs"
false
conquer.core=> (time (empty? (candidator (range 100000) 17)))
"Elapsed time: 0.070474 msecs"
false

```

#### A more transparent version,
```clojure
(defn wrapper [vec k]
  (let [candidates (candidator vec k)]
      {:candidates candidates
      :at-least-one-though? (not (empty? candidates))})
  )

(defn rand-seq [n] (take n (repeatedly #(rand-int 10)))) 
```

```clojure
conquer.core=> (def vec1 (rand-seq 20))
#'conquer.core/vec1
conquer.core=> vec1
(8 3 6 2 9 6 8 0 8 4 5 2 2 8 4 1 9 9 3 7)

conquer.core=> (wrapper vec1 17)
{:candidates ([8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [8 9] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8] [9 8]), :at-least-one-though? true}


```
* Using the rand-seq instead of just a range adds time though. Probably the predictive lazy seq prefetching longer in that case?
```clojure
conquer.core=> (time (first (candidator (rand-seq 1000000) 17)))
"Elapsed time: 5273.466579 msecs"
[9 8]
conquer.core=> (time (first (candidator (range 1000000) 17)))
"Elapsed time: 0.090704 msecs"
[0 17]

```
